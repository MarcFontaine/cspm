#CSPM-Frontend

CSP-M is the machine readable syntax of CSP (concurrent sequential processes)
as used by the formal methods tools FDR, Probe and ProB.
This Package contains functions for lexing, parsing, renaming and pretty-printing
CSP-M specifications.
The parser is (almost) 100% compatible with the FDR-2.91 parser.
